## Abstract 

<p align="justify">The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been taking place in many applications nowadays. Although there might be hesitation when it comes to healthcare, especially to image disease diagnosis, since human eye diagnosis cannot be replaced, there are many efforts to Deep Learning (DL) increasingly becoming accepted among health agencies around the world. With regards to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), recent studies have shown that image processing and analysis through DL algorithms are considerably briefer procedures than visual analysis of experienced doctors. The main imaging techniques of diagnosis are Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). There are already many studies about applying AI to images from both of these imaging modalities, aiming to transpose the limitations for some image diagnoses like for PDAC. In this paper, we aimed to analyze articles and proposals of Deep Learning applications for the early detection of PDAC in CT images.</p>
